## This is a markdown file 
* This is R Markdown! It's pretty nifty. 
* You can make bullet points by starting each line with an asterisk and a space followed by your content, and ended with a space. That space at the end is easy to forget, but important. 
* To make headers of nesting level n, put n #'s and a space before the text. Again space is important - without that, it won't work! 
* To *italicize* text, but a * before and after. To **bold** text, put ** before and after. No spaces this time.
* To include links, do put the link text in brackets and the link destination immediately after, in parenthesis. For example, there's more helpful info on how to use R Markdown [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html).
